unicode-screensaver

unicode-screensaver is a simple screensaver application that repeatedly
randomly picks an unicode character and displays it in a very large font
size together with its unicode code point and the character name.

Installation
============

The unicode screensaver depends on these libraries:
 * libx11
 * libxmu
 * libxt
 * libxft
 * libfontconfig

You need to have the respective developer packages installed to compile
unicode-screensaver. On Debian and derived distributions, these packages
are required:
 libx11-dev libxmu-dev libxt-dev libxft-dev libfontconfig1-dev

You can compile and install the screensaver as usual by running
 ./configure && make && make install

To make sure that xscreensaver knows about your screen hack, please read
the man pages for xscreensaver and xscreensaver-demo.
